abstract = {Pacific Islanders (PI) are a vulnerable population with a high prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) sexually transmitted infections and remain underrepresented in research. Here, 258 vaginal and 92 paired endocervical samples from women of diverse ethnicities in Fiji were analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Using VALENCIA, a sub-community state type (subCST) classifier, 93 (36.04\%) vaginal and 38 (41.30\%) endocervical microbiomes did not match reference subCSTs. We, therefore, designed four unique subCSTs, IV-D0, IV-D1, IV-D2, and IV-E—differentially dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., and Lactobacillus iners—to improve microbiome classifications. Ct-infected paired endocervical and vaginal microbiomes were significantly more likely to have differential species relative abundance (81.58\%) than uninfected pairs (35.84\%; adjusted odds ratio, 7.93; 95\% confidence interval, 2.93–21.93; P \&lt; 0.0001). Among paired microbiomes, the endocervix had a significantly higher alpha diversity and independently a higher alpha diversity for high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) types compared to low-risk and no HPV. The Ct-infected endocervical network compared to all others had smaller clusters—indicating lower species abundance and decreased weight of interactions among bacterial groups within clusters—and no interactions with potentially beneficial Lactobacillus spp. These data suggest a distinct influence on this network from Ct-infected endocervical cells. Furthermore, the high relative abundance of G. vaginalis and Prevotella spp. may generate polymicrobial biofilms that predispose to and/or promote Ct and possibly HPV persistence and pathogenicity. While these data expand on the existing repertoire of endocervical and vaginal microbiomes and fill in knowledge gaps regarding PIs, prospective studies are needed to define causal associations to develop successful interventions. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common sexually transmitted bacterium globally. Endocervical and vaginal microbiome interactions are rarely examined within the context of Ct or among vulnerable populations. We evaluated 258 vaginal and 92 paired endocervical samples from Fijian women using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Over 37\% of the microbiomes could not be classified into sub-community state types (subCSTs). We, therefore, developed subCSTs IV-D0, IV-D1, IV-D2, and IV-E—dominated primarily by Gardnerella vaginalis—to improve classification. Among paired microbiomes, the endocervix had a significantly higher alpha diversity and, independently, higher diversity for high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) genotypes compared to low-risk and no HPV. Ct-infected endocervical networks had smaller clusters without interactions with potentially beneficial Lactobacillus spp. Overall, these data suggest that G. vaginalis may generate polymicrobial biofilms that predispose to and/or promote Ct and possibly HPV persistence and pathogenicity. Our findings expand on the existing repertoire of endocervical and vaginal microbiomes and fill in knowledge gaps regarding Pacific Islanders. }

abstract = {Understanding epithelial stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis during breast tissue development is essential, as disruption in these processes underlie breast cancer formation. We used a next-generation single-cell-derived organoid model to investigate how individual stem cells give rise to complex tissue. We show that discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) inhibition traps cells in a bipotent state, blocking alveolar morphogenesis and luminal cell expansion, which is necessary for complex epithelium formation. Disrupting RUNX1 function produced nearly identical phenotypes, underscoring its critical role downstream of DDR1. Mechanistically, DDR1 affects the interaction and expression of RUNX1 and its cofactor core binding factor beta (CBFβ), thereby regulating its activity. Mutational analyses in breast cancer patients reveal frequent alterations in the DDR1-RUNX1 signaling axis, particularly co-occurring mutations. Together, these findings uncover DDR1-RUNX1 as a central signaling pathway driving breast epithelial differentiation, whose dysregulation may contribute fundamentally to breast cancer pathogenesis.}

abstract = {Infection with the COVID-19-causing pathogen SARS-CoV-2 is associated with disruption in the human gut microbiome. The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations.
We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020–2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 83 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 43 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases.
Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection.}}
