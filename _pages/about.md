I am a graduate researcher in the Przytycki Lab at Boston University, where my PhD work focuses on computational biology and bioinformatics.

I completed my bachelorâ€™s degrees in Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley, where I developed a strong foundation in both biological systems and computational methods. During my time at Berkeley, I worked with Dr. Ashley Wolf to build machine learning models that integrate gut metagenomic data across diverse populations to improve predictive accuracy.

In parallel, I conducted research with Dr. Deborah Dean at UCSF, focusing on the urogenital microbiome. My work examined Gardnerella vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, other STIs, and the dynamics of vaginal community state types (CSTs), applying metagenomic approaches to better understand microbial diversity in reproductive health.
